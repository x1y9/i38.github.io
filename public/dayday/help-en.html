    <h3>How do I use an Unscheduled task?</h3>
    <p>Unscheduled task is removed from dayday 1.9.0, before that:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Unscheduled tasks refer to tasks that are similar to three times a week, but not fixed on a certain day. Such tasks cannot be daily tasks, and there are intervals, such as every Sunday, or every three days. </li>
      <li>Unscheduled tasks can be punched at any time on the homepage. In fact, it is calculated on the next effective day, and there is no data on the invalid days. </li>
      <li>Under the history page and the task details page, you cannot modify the data of the invalid days, but you can modify the data of the effective day. </li>
    </ul>
