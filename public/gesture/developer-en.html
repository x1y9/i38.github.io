<h4>Introduction</h4>
<code>There are a variety of plugins for Micro Gesture, the main ones are as follows.<br/>
* All common commands are a plug-in, you can input commands and parameters directly in the plug-in input box, refer to Appendix I.<br/>
* The beginning of intent: is the Android intent url, which can be entered directly as a plugin.<br/>
* The beginning of ss: is a super shortcut of Micro Gesture, which can be interpreted as a set of commands executed continuously, which is the most distinctive part of Micro Gesture and is described in detail below.<br/><br/>

Note that plugins are <red>case sensitive</red>. The automation feature for Micro Gesture also supports triggering a plugin, also using several of the above plugins. <br/>
</code>

<h4>Super Shortcut</h4>
<code>Super shortcuts are supported after <red>version 4.3.4</red> of Micro Gesture, as a simple example.<br/>
<red>ss:[{"a":"com.tencent.mm"}]</red><br/>
It is a simple super shortcut to launch WeChat. Here the part enclosed in brackets after ss: is a json format array, please refer to Appendix II for detailed description of json format.<br/><br/>
Each super shortcut is a set of actions enclosed in <red>[]</red>, where a single action is a json object enclosed in <red>{}</red>, and the object includes some properties, for example, "a" is a property that indicates the action to be done by this instruction, followed by "com.tencent.mm" which is the value of this action. This is the package id of an Android version of WeChat, which means start WeChat. The following will explain the format of the plugin command in detail.
</code>

<h4>Action Object</h4>
<code>Each action object can include the following properties:<br/>
1. "a" indicates the action to be performed, this attribute is the most complicated, besides the Android package id described above, it can also take many values, refer to Appendix I, but pay attention to this value <red> is case-sensitive</red>.<br/>
2. "d" indicates the delay time in milliseconds, this delay was divided into positive and negative delay, positive delay was after execution, negative delay was before execution delay, after <red>5.5.4</red> it is no longer distinguished, it is unified as pre-execution delay, and negative values are no longer meaningful. <br/>
3. "n" indicates the screen element to be matched. <br/>
4. "p" indicates the package where the screen element to be matched is located.<br/>
</code>

<h4>Continuous action</h4>
<code>According to the definition of action object, we can define some continuous instructions, such as<br/>
<red>ss:[{"a":"2"},{"a":"click:150:150","d":300}]</red><br/>
It means go back to the main screen first, then click on the screen 150, 150(coordinate point), here both instructions are enclosed in curly brackets and separated by a comma on it.<br/>
Also note that the second action here adds a "d" delay of 300 milliseconds, is to consider back to the main screen usually has animation, so add a delay to ensure that the animation has been completed.
</code>

<h4>UI Matching</h4>
<code>There are times when we want to match an element of the interface and then perform the corresponding action, e.g.<br/>
<red>ss:[{"a":"com.tencent.mm"},{"a":"k","n":"Discover"},{"a":"k:10","n":"Moments"}]</red><br/>
This plug-in has three instructions, the first one is to start WeChat by package id, the second instruction has an n attribute, <red>"n": "Discover"</red> means match "Discover" this interface element, after the successful match execute the "k" action, refer to Appendix I, we know that the k action is to click on this matched element, so the equivalent is after the start of WeChat. Click "Discover", then the third instruction is to match "Moments" and click, the click here is written as k:10 because the interface nesting of WeChat is too complex and needs to control the depth of the click, please refer to the following click mode. So the entire role of this super shortcut is to enter the WeChat Moments in one step.<br/><br/>

Note that the two matching instructions here do not need to add a delay, because they are all clicked only when the match is successful, and when the match is successful, the interface has been loaded, so there is no need to delay, in addition, because after the match is usually a click, we can omit the click action, the entire plug-in that is simplified as follows<br/>
<red>ss:[{"a":"com.tencent.mm"},{"n":"Discover"},{"a":"k:10","n":"Moments"}]</red><br/>
</code>

<h4>Matching mode</h4>
<code>There are various ways to match UI elements.<br/>
* Strict matching, such as <red>{"n": "found"}</red> is only matching an element whose content is exactly "found".<br/>
* Fuzzy matching, for example <red>{"n":"~found"}</red> is to match the element whose content contains "found", and if there are more than one element, return the first one that matches.<br/>
* Id match, for example <red>{"n": "#action"}</red> matches an element with the id "action", which is an attribute of the Android UI element.<br/>
* Find match, e.g. <red>{"n":"^found"}</red> This is a special way to try it if the element is present in the UI but neither of the two above match.<br/>

</code>

<h4>Matching filters</h4>
<code>In some cases if more than one UI element is matched, the desired element can be selected by adding the filter ("f" attribute), which splits multiple conditions with a semicolon, the conditions can be v (visible), c(clickable), e(editable), w(width), h(height), x/y(center coordinates), x1/y1/x2/y2(top left and bottom right coordinates). The following are explained separately.<br/>
* A visible filter, such as <red>v</red> is to match only elements that are visible on the screen, which can also be written as v=1. If you want to match invisible elements, you need to write v=0.<br/>
* Position filtering, for example <red>x1=800</red> is to match only elements whose center x coordinate is at 800.<br/>
* A size filter, such as <red>w>100;h=200</red> is to match only elements whose width is greater than 100 and whose height is equal to 200.<br/><br/>
For a complete example, <red>{"n": "found", "f": "v;x=800"}</red> matches only the "found" elements that are visible on the screen and have a center x coordinate of 800, ignoring other "found" elements.
</code>

<h4>Pixel Matching</h4>
<code>Due to the limitations of Android accessibility, it is difficult to match UI elements of some apps, especially some apps that use webview, such as WeChat/Alipay mini programs, etc. For matching such apps, <red>5.6.0</red> of Micro Gesture provides another matching mode, pixel matching, which uses pixel-by-pixel matching on the screen and can match any pixel defined in advance. The pixel match still uses the "n" attribute, but starts with @, followed by the coordinates and color, e.g.<br/>
* <red>{"n":"@100,100,fffff"}</red> would match the white pixel point 100,100, the color format is hexadecimal RGB format, fffff is white.<br/>
* <red>{"n":"@100,100,a0a0a0,100,101,ececec"}</red> matches two pixel points, 100,100 and 100,101, respectively. Matching two pixels with different colors can greatly reduce the probability of false matches.<br/><br/>

Due to Android limitations, pixel matching needs to be enabled and given authorization in Micro Gesture Lab first, and requires authorization after every restart of Micro Gesture, Also note that:<br/>
* The filter is not valid in pixel matching mode.<br/>
* Pixel matching is only available in super shortcut, and is not supported in element matching of automation.<br/>
</code>

<h4>Click Mode</h4>
<code>Most of the actions performed after a successful match are clicks, or "k" action, which can be controlled by parameters for the click mode:<br/>
* Normal mode (with parameter 0), e.g. <red>{"a": "k:0", "n": "found"}</red>, triggers a click directly if the element is clickable, otherwise it uses the element's position on the screen to compute a center coordinate for simulating a click.<br/>
* Parent mode (parameter greater than 0), for example, <red>{"a": "k:5", "n": "found"}</red>, if the element can be clicked, directly trigger the click, otherwise recursive upward level by level to see if the parent element can be clicked, up to 5 levels of recursive parent elements, this mode will not simulating coordinate click.<br/>
* Coordinate mode (with parameters less than 0), such as <red>{"a": "k:-1", "n": "found"}</red>, will use the element's position on the screen directly after a successful match to compute a center coordinate for simulating a click, regardless of whether the element is clickable or not.<br/><br/>

If there are no parameters, then there are two more cases.<br/>
* In automation, the above normal mode is used by default, because in automation scenarios, many times you need to simulate coordinate clicks to succeed.<br/>
* In Super Shortcut, the above Parent mode is used by default(k:9), because in Super Shortcut scenarios, element-based clicks are more common, but you can adapt your own scenario by adding parameters to the code.<br/>

After <red>version 5.6.7</red> an offset click was added, which takes two parameters and indicates the offset in xy coordinates at the element centroid, for example:<br/>
<red>{"a": "k:10:-50", "n": "found"}</red> will then add 10 to x and subtract 50 from y based on the center coordinates of the matched element and simulate a click.
</code>

<h4>Variables</h4>
<code>Some actions that support parameters can use variables as part of the parameters. The global variables currently supported by Micro Gesture are:<br/>
* {trigger}, identifies the source of the automation trigger, such as notification trigger, which indicates the content of the notification, and UI trigger, which indicates the text of the interface.<br/>
* {date} for the current date, e.g. the <red>V:{date}</red> command inserts the current date.<br/>
* {time}, the current time.<br/>
* {datetime}, the current date and time.<br/><br/>

Variables can be converted to regular expressions using the <red>re</red> command to generate new variables in the format re:source:target:group:regular-expression, as an example.<br/>
* <red>re:trigger:code:0:[0-9]{4,6}</red> is to identify 4 to 6 digits in the <red>trigger</red> variable and put them into a new <red>code</red> variable.<br/>
</code>

<h4>Usage examples</h4>
<code><red>ss:[{"a":"com.tencent.mm"},{"n":"Discover"},{"n":"Mini Programs","d":1000},{"n":"^My Mini Programs"}]</red><br/>
This super shortcut is used to open the WeChat My Mini Programs directly.<br/>
* The third step is to delay 1 second before clicking on the "Mini Programs" because the interface of WeChat has a dynamic loading process, so if you click too early, you will enter other functional items, so you must delay the click.<br/>
* The fourth step of matching needs to use ^ mode, otherwise it won't match, which is caused by the complexity of this interface of WeChat.<br/><br/>
</code>

<code><red>ss:[{"a":"3"},{"p":"com.miui.home","n":"#clearAnimView"}]</red><br/>
This super shortcut is used to trigger MIUI's background cleanup action.<br/>
* For the first step of command "3", please refer to Appendix I. This is used to open the multitasking screen.<br/>
* The second step is to trigger the cleanup button, the button has an id, so use # to match the id directly, but the Android control id is with package, so use the "p" property to specify the package.<br/><br/>
</code>

<code><red>ss:[{"a":"com.tencent.mm"},{"n":"行程卡"},{"a":"click:500:1500","d":"3000"},{"a":"click:500:1700","d":500}]</red><br/>
This shortcut is used to open the trip card of WeChat, make sure you have opened it once manually before executing it.<br/>
* The third step is to check the "Agree..." checkbox by simulating a click. Check the box, in order to wait for the page to load, you need to wait enough time, here is waiting for 3 seconds, click the coordinates need to be modified according to the specific phone layout.<br/>
* The coordinates of the last click step also need to be adjusted according to the layout, plus a delay of 500 milliseconds, because the button has to wait a while before it can be clicked after the click of the previous step agrees.<br/><br/>
</code>

<code><red>ss:[{"a":"com.android.browser"},{"n":"Jingdong"},{"n":"^京东超市"}]</red><br/>
This shortcut is used to open the web version of Jingdong Supermarket.<br/>
* The second step matches Jingdong from a Jingdong bookmark on your browser home page, if your browser home page does not have this bookmark, this step will time out.<br/>
* The third step at this time has opened the home page of Jingdong, to match the elements in the browser, you must use ^ mode.<br/><br/>

<h4>Appendix II: JSON format</h4>
<code>JSON is a lightweight data representation method that uses key:value to record data, which is very intuitive and easy to extend. key is the attribute name, which must be caused by double quotes, and value is the attribute value, which can be one of the following types.<br/>
* Numbers (integer or floating point)<br/>
* String (in double quotes)<br/>
* Logical value (true or false)<br/>
* Arrays (in square brackets)<br/>
* Object (in brackets)<br/>
* null<br/><br/>

JSON arrays and objects are nestable, and thus represent complex data, e.g.
<pre>
{
"employees": [
  { "firstName":"John" , "lastName":"Doe" },
  {"firstName":"Anna" , "lastName":"Smith" },
  { "firstName":"Peter" , "lastName":"Jones" }
 ]
}
</pre>
This is an object with only one property employees, which takes the value of an array (the part enclosed in middle brackets), and three objects in the array (the part enclosed in curly brackets), each of which includes two more properties, firstName and lastName.
</code>

<h4>Appendix III: Repetition of simulated gestures</h4>
<code>Micro Gesture after <red>version 5.4.6</red> some instructions that simulate gestures can be controlled by parameters whether to simulate multiple gestures, these instructions include g,h,i,j,G,H,click,N, where g,h,i,j,G,H are all instructions for scrolling, the difference between them is that g,h,i,j is simulating a swipe gesture, the four instructions correspond to four directions, G,H is by adjusting the scroll bar, and only supports the up and down direction. The exact format of these commands is as follows.<br/>
* click command with parameters<red>:x:y:duration:times:delay</red>, for example <red>click:150:150:800:3:1000</red> means long click at coordinate point 150,150 for 800 milliseconds, executed 3 times, each time with 1000 milliseconds delay.<br/>
* N command with parameters<red>:x1:y1:x2:y2:duration:times:delay</red>, for example <red>N:150:150:200:300:100:5:500</red> means sliding from coordinate point 150,150 to 200:300, executing 5 times with 500 milliseconds delay each time.<br/>
<br/>
Once these repetitive instructions are executed and you want to interrupt, there are two ways to do so.<br/>
* The "p" or "s" command that triggers a pause or stop, both of which terminate the repeating gesture being executed.<br/>
* In the case of super shortcuts, a continuous scroll command followed by an n command, i.e. a click on the matching node, terminates the repeating gesture being executed once the match is successful and clicked.<br/>
</code>

<h4>Appendix IV: Text Parameters and Variable Substitution</h4>
<code>Micro Gesture actions such as W,V,X, can carry a text parameter, this parameter can use any variable, the variable is enclosed in curly brackets in the parameter, in the execution, the variable will be replaced with the current value. It is also possible to use multiple variables in a parameter, for example.<br/>
* <red>V:{date}{time}</red> to insert the current date and time into the edit box in the current screen.<br/>
* <red>W:1:Execution successful</red>, send a notification of successful execution, the first parameter is the notification channel, currently supports four channels, namely 1,2,3,4.<br/>
* <red>X:{code}</red>, take the contents of the code variable and copy it to the clipboard.<br/><br/>
</code>

<h4>Appendix V: Simulation of multi-touch</h4>
<code>The T command can simulate a multi-touch gesture with parameters that carry the coordinate positions of multiple fingers, for example <red>T:10:10:20:20:90:90:100:100:300</red> means the first finger slides from 10:10 to 20:20 and the second finger slides from 90:90 to 100:100 for 300 milliseconds, and if there are more If there are more fingers, you can continue to increase in front of the duration.<br/><br/>

Multi-touch does not support repetitions for now.
</code>

<h4>Appendix VI: Developer Tools</h4>
<code>After <red>5.6.1 version</red>, two developer tools have been added, layout view and screen color picking. These two tools and the flying mouse share a common command word m, which is distinguished by parameters, m or m:0 for the flying mouse, m:1 for the layout view tool, and m:2 for the color picking tool.<br/>
</code>

<h4>Appendix VII: Switching parameters</h4>
<code>After <red>version 5.6.7</red>, the parameters of some switch commands have been added. The parameters can be 0/off for off, 1/on for on, or without parameters for toggle, and the following commands support switch parameters.<br/>
* Wifi<br/>
* Bluetooth<br/>
* Location<br/>
* NFC<br/>
* Torch<br/>
For example, <red>E:0</red> means Bluetooth off, <red>E:1</red> or <red>E:on</red> means Bluetooth on, and <red>E</red> without parameters toggles Bluetooth.<br/>
